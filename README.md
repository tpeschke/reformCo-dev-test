## About

This project is to showcase my skills to [Reform Collective](https://www.reformcollective.com/) in hopes that they'll like it and pay me to do this full time and for money.

It is a simple, one-page app showcasing my proficiency with following a Figma design, applying animation, and general React / Next.js understanding as well as communication when ambiguities arise in the design.
